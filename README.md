# dig

dig is a git diff viewer in terminal.

It displays commits and it's diff in one screen.

By default it displays commits first-to-latest order.
Because it's the main reason that I created dig.
I wanted to explore git repositories from the beginning.


## install

`go get -u github.com/kybin/dig`


## run

`dig # from git repository`

# git-dig

git-dig is a git diff history viewer in terminal.

By default it displays commits first-to-latest order.
Because it's the main reason that I created dig.
I wanted to explore git repositories from the beginning.


## install

Download a pre-built binary if it exists.

Or you could build yourself with Go.

`go get -u github.com/kybin/git-dig`


## run

`git dig # from git repository`
